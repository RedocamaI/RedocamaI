Hey, folks!  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

This is Suraj Kumar Barnwal, a CSE undergrad, fresher from BIT Sindri, Dhanbad. I love sharing my ideas on Github.  I have been passionate about Computer Science since I first saw it with my own eyes, in my school's Computer lab about ***10 years ago***. Since then, my life has changed. Now, I love to talk to my PC, in some special kind of language, which we call ***programming language***. When some **cryptic** looking text gives life to software, it's a real thrill for me. Getting stuck for hours and days, maybe even months is a bliss for me accompanied by obvious frustrations. I don't know where this coding journey will lead me, but I do have some plans.
